Unit 12 Practice Problems (Unit 13 Day 1 mini practicum)

The goal of these "mini practica" is to give you practice with coding problems
similar to those that you will see on the midterm practica. You will be 
required to solve each problem with minimal assistance. You should use these
mini-practica as an opportunity to gauge your preparedness for the exams.

You should create all of your required files in this folder along with these
instructions.

Each mini-practicum counts as a homework assignment. 

================================================================================

0. Note that you have been provided with the array_queue and node_stack modules
   that provide implementations of the queue and stack data structures that 
   were discussed in the previous unit. When solving each of the following 
   problems, choose the correct data structure. Your solution MUST make use of
   the correct data structure in a significant way. 


1. Create a new module named "practice" and define a function named 
   "reverse_digits" that declares a parameter for an integer. Your function
   should return an integer with the digits in reverse order.

   Hint: consider casting the integer into a string and back again.

   Example Input    Expected Output
   1                1
   34               43
   1002             2001
   1000             1

2. In a game of "Hot Potato," contestants stand in a circle and toss a potato 
   (usually a ball or some other small object) from one person to the next while
   music plays. When the music stops, the person holding the "potato" is 
   eliminated. Play continues until there is only one person remaining. 
   
   Define a function named "hot_potato" that declares a parameter for a list of
   names and simulates a game of hot potato. Your similation must meet the 
   following requirements:

   a. Each "round" shall consist of a random number of 1-5 tosses from one 
      player to the next.
   b. When the round stops, the person holding the potato is eliminated.
   c. Play continues until there is only one player remaining. The last player 
      is the winner.

   Example Output:

   Bobby tosses the potato to Bruce
   Bruce tosses the potato to Chris
   Chris tosses the potato to Dave
   Dave tosses the potato to Bobby
   Bobby tosses the potato to Bruce
   The music stops and Bruce is holding the potato!
   Chris tosses the potato to Dave
   The music stops and Dave is holding the potato!
   Bobby tosses the potato to Chris
   Chris tosses the potato to Bobby
   The music stops and Bobby is holding the potato!
   The game is over! Chris wins the game!
